Chapter One

-Enlightenment is simply your natural state of felt oneness with Being.
-Being is the eternal life force that is in everything, from the trees to the cow, to the sun, to the light.
-The inability to stop thinking is a curse
-You are not your mind, your mind is a tool
-The moment you start watching the mind, watching the thinker, a higher level of consiousness is achieved.


Freeing yourself from your mind
- The constant monologues inside your head stoppable.
- The mind speculates, judges, comapres, complains, likes and dislikes.
- The mind isnt always necessarily relevant to the situation you find yourself in.
- Even if the mind is relevant it will be percieving the situation in terms of the past, a dillusional, untrue, unreal form.
- This voice drains vital energy from one's self.
- To watch the mind, listen to the voice, without judgement or condemnation, for this would be the voice doing so.
- When you listen to the voice also be aware that you are listening, the watcher.
- This state allows greater consciousness of that around you.
- Another way to enter this state is to fully concentrate on some menial task such as folding laundry

Enlightenment Rising above Thought.
-The mind is a tool, to be used for a task, then set down.
-The reason for thinking addiction is that one derives their sense of self from the content and activity of the mind.
