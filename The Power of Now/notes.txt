The Greatest Obstacle to Enlightenment

-Enlightenment is simply your natural state of felt oneness with Being.
-Being is the eternal life force that is in everything, from the trees to the cow, to the sun, to the light.
-The inability to stop thinking is a curse
-You are not your mind, your mind is a tool
-The moment you start watching the mind, watching the thinker, a higher level of consiousness is achieved.


Freeing yourself from your mind
- The constant monologues inside your head stoppable.
- The mind speculates, judges, comapres, complains, likes and dislikes.
- The mind isnt always necessarily relevant to the situation you find yourself in.
- Even if the mind is relevant it will be percieving the situation in terms of the past, a dillusional, untrue, unreal form.
- This voice drains vital energy from one's self.
- To watch the mind, listen to the voice, without judgement or condemnation, for this would be the voice doing so.
- When you listen to the voice also be aware that you are listening, the watcher.
- This state allows greater consciousness of that around you.
- Another way to enter this state is to fully concentrate on some menial task such as folding laundry

Enlightenment Rising above Thought.
-The mind is a tool, to be used for a task, then set down.
-The reason for thinking addiction is that one derives their sense of self from the content and activity of the mind.
-80 to 90 percent of peoples thinking is repetative and useless.
-Through this thinking one creates the ego, a mental image of oneself.
-The ego either sees the present skewed by the past, or as a means to an end for the future.
-Thinking and consciousness are not the same, one can exist without the other, but not vice versa.

Emotion: The Body's Reaction to your mind
-Emotions are a reflection of your mind into the body, it originates from the mind.
-The more you are identified with your thinking, your likes and dislikes, judgments and interpretations, which is to say the less present you are, the stronger the emotional energy charge will be.
-Observe the body, search for how your body is feeling, search for emotion. Watch.
-The harder the mind stuggles to get rid of the pain, the greater the pain. The mind is an intrinsic part of the "problem".
- With pleasure there will always be pain, the only way to loose all pain is to become concious.

Create no more pain in the present
-The pain that you create now is always some form of non acceptance to what IS.
-Imagine an Earth devoid of human life, would there still be time?
-The present moment is all you ever have
-Observe how the mind labels the present moment.
-Accept... then ACT.

Past Pain Dissolving the pain body.
-Watch for any sign of unhappiness in yourself.
-All pain is ultimately an illusion
-Observe the pain, do not fight it, do not judge it.
-Watching pain implies accepting it as part of what IS at that moment.
-Stay present, stay concious, stay the ever present gaudrian of your inner space

Ego Identification with the Pain-Body
-When a log that has only just started to burn is placed next to one that is burning fiercly, and after a while they are seperated again, the first log will be burning with much greater intensity.

The Origin of Fear
- The fear mentioned here, is not the instinctive shrinking back from danger.
- Fear is ultimately the ego's fear of annihalation.For the mind made image of onesself, to be proven as false.
- Once you have disidentified from your mind, whether you are right or wrong makes no difference to your sense of self at all, so the compulsive need to be right is gone.
- True power is within.
- Virtually everyone lives in a state of fear, ancxiety, dread.
