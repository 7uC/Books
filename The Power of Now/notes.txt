Chapter One

-Enlightenment is simply your natural state of felt oneness with Being.
-Being is the eternal life force that is in everything, from the trees to the cow, to the sun, to the light.
-The inability to stop thinking is a curse
-You are not your mind, your mind is a tool
-The moment you start watching the mind, watching the thinker, a higher level of consiousness is achieved.


Freeing yourself from your mind
